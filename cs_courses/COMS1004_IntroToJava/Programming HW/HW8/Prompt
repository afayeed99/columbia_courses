Implement a version of video poker. In this game we start with a full deck of 52 standard playing cards. 
Each card belongs to one of four suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, or Spades, and has a rank chosen from the set 
{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace}. Before each game, the deck is shuffled and player bets 1-5 tokens. 
If a player bets n tokens and they win, (see below) they are paid n times the payout listed next to the hands below. 
To start the game the top five cards of the deck are presented to the player. These make up the player’s hand. 
After receiving all five cards the player can choose to reject none, some, or all of the cards. 
After choosing which cards to accept and reject, the rejected cards are replaced by the cards at the top of the deck. 
Now the hand is evaluated. Your program should determine the hand to be one of the following:

No pair - The lowest hand. Five separate cards that do not match up to create any of the hands listed below. Payout: 0 tokens. (player loses)
One pair - Two cards of the same rank, for example two queens. Payout: 1 token. (player ties)
Two pairs - Two pairs, for example two queens and two 5’s. Payout: 2 tokens. (player wins)
Three of a kind - Three cards of the same rank, for example three queens. Payout: 3 tokens. (player wins)
Straight - Five cards with consecutive ranks, not necessarily of the same suit for example 4,5,6,7, and 8. 
The ace can either precede a 2 or follow a king. Payout: 4 tokens. (player wins)
Flush - Five cards, non necessarily in order, of the same suit. Payout: 5 tokens. (player wins)
Full House - Three of a kind and a pair, for example three queens and two 5’s. Payout: 6 tokens. (player wins)
Four of a Kind - Four cards of the same rank, such as four queens. Payout: 25 tokens. (player wins)
Straight Flush - A straight and a flush: Five cards with consecutive ranks all of the same suit. Payout: 50 tokens. (player wins)
Royal Flush - The best possible hand. A straight flush that begins with rank 10 and ends with ace. Payout: 250 tokens. (player wins)
