1. Do Practice Exercise 4.21.1 on Zybook. 
For this problem you should edit the five template files named E1a.java, 
E1b.java, E1c.java, E1d.java, and E1e.java that are on Codio. 
No object-oriented structure is required here. This is just an exercise in using loops.

2. Write a BankTest class whose main method constructs a BankAccount object, deposits $10,000, 
withdraws $600, withdraws another $200, and then prints the remaining balance. 
I have included the BankAccount.java file from lecture on Codio. 
You must complete the provided BankTest.java file. 
This one should not be very difficult given what we have done in lecture.

3. Write a class Car with two instance variables, one for the gas mileage in miles per gallon and one 
for the gas in gallons remaining in the tank. The gas mileage should be specified in the Car constructor 
and the gas remaining in the tank should be initialized to zero when a new Car object is instantiated. 
Write a constructor and three methods: drive, addGas and gasLeft. The method drive is a mutator that
reduces the amount of gas in the tank when the car is driven a specified distance in miles using 
the gas mileage to determine by exactly how much. You can assume that the distance specified is 
always within the current range of the car given the current amount of gas in the tank. 
The method addGas is a mutator method that adds a specified amount of gas in gallons to the tank. 
The method gasLeft is an accessor method that returns the amount of gas currently lef in the tank. 
I have provided a test class, CarTester.java, for your Car class. Your class must work with this 
test class and you must not change this test class. I have also provided a template Car.java that 
you should use when making your Car class.

4. Do Practice Exercise 5.24.3 on Zybook. Use the provided Circuit.java file for making your Circuit class. 
Your class must work with the provided test class CircuitTest.java and you must not alter this test class.
Simulate a circuit for controlling a hallway light that has switches at both ends of the hallway. 
Each switch can be up or down, and the light can be on or off. 
Toggling either switch turns the lamp on or off. Provide methods

public int getFirstSwitchState() // 0 for down, 1 for up
public int getSecondSwitchState()
public int getLampState() // 0 for off, 1 for on
public void toggleFirstSwitch()
public void toggleSecondSwitch()
