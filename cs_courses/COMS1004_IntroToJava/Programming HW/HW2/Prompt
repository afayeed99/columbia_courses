1. Create an application in Java that asks a user for a number of days and weeks and 
computes the equivalent number of minutes. To do this, edit the file Minutes.java included on Codio.

2. Do Programming Project 2.20.1 from the Zybook. To do this, edit the file Easter.java included on Codio.
Easter Sunday is the first Sunday after the first full moon of spring. 
To compute the date, you can use this algorithm, invented by the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1800:

Let y be the year (such as 1800 or 2001).
Divide y by 19 and call the remainder a. Ignore the quotient.
Divide y by 100 to get a quotient b and a remainder c.
Divide b by 4 to get a quotient d and a remainder e.
Divide 8 * b + 13 by 25 to get a quotient g. Ignore the remainder.
Divide 19 * a + b - d - g + 15 by 30 to get a remainder h. Ignore the quotient.
Divide c by 4 to get a quotient j and a remainder k.
Divide a + 11 * h by 319 to get a quotient m. Ignore the remainder.
Divide 2 * e + 2 * j - k - h + m + 32 by 7 to get a remainder r. Ignore the quotient.
Divide h - m + r + 90 by 25 to get a quotient n. Ignore the remainder.
Divide h - m + r + n + 19 by 32 to get a remainder p. Ignore the quotient.
Then Easter falls on day p of month n. For example, if y is 2001:

a = 6            g = 6           m = 0    n = 4
b = 20, c = 1    h = 18          r = 6    p = 15
d = 5, e = 0     j = 0, k = 1
Therefore, in 2001, Easter Sunday fell on April 15. Write a program that prompts 
the user for a year and prints out the month and day of Easter Sunday.

3. Do Programming Project 2.20.6 from the Zybook. To do this, edit the file Change.java included on Codio.
Giving change. Implement a program that directs a cashier how to give change. The program has two inputs: 
the amount due and the amount received from the customer. Display the dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, 
and pennies that the customer should receive in return. In order to avoid roundoff errors, 
the program user should supply both amounts in pennies, for example 274 instead of 2.74.
