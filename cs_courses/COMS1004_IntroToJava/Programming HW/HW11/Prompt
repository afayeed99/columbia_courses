Problem 1 - 10 points
Zybook Programming Exercise 10.13.8
In the file Problem1.java implement a static method with the signature:

public static boolean find(String text, String str)

Your method should recursively test whether a given text contains a string. For example find("Mississippi", "sip") returns true. 
You may not use the contains method of the String class for this. If you do, you will not earn credit.

Hint: If the text starts with the string you want to match, then you are done. If not, consider the text that you obtain by removing the first character.

Your method must work in the main method provided in the Problem1.java file. Do not alter the main method!

Problem 2 - 10 points
Zybook Programming Exercise 10.13.10
In the file Problem2.java implement a static method with the signature:

public static int findLargest(int[] a, int n)

Your method should recursively find the largest value in an array of integers and return that value. You may assume that each value appears in the array only once.

Hint: Find the largest element in the subset containing all but the last element. Then compare that maximum to the value of the last element.

Your method must work in the main method provided in the Problem2.java file. Do not alter the main method!

Problem 3 - 20 points
In the file Problem3.java implement a a recursive version of binary search that searches the array a for the target x using a static method with the signature:

public static int binarySearch(Comparable[] a, Comparable x)

Your method should return the index of the element if itâ€™s found (you may assume that each element appears only once in the array). Return -1 if the element is not found.

You may find it very beneficial to use a helper method that performs the recursive search on a portion of the array. this helper method would have a method signature like this:

private static int binaryHelper(Comparable[] a, Comparable x, int start, int end)
