What you need to do:

In this assignment you will create a Zipcode class. Your Zipcode class will have two constructors: 
One will require a 5 digit Zip Code (int) as an explicit parameter and the other a bar code (String). 
This is so you can create a Zipcode object using either a bar code or a Zip Code. 
When a Zipcode object is instantiated it should automatically figure out the other representation, 
bar code or Zip Code, so that a user can request either via an accessor.

What you need to submit:

Your program will consist of two classes: ZipTest and Zipcode. ZipTest is already written for you on Codio. 
You must not change it and you should NOT submit it. A template for Zipcode is also on Codio. 
You may wish to add methods or instance variables to your Zipcode class, that's fine.  
Your final Zipcode class must work with the provided ZipTest class. Remember to also submit a README.txt file! 
All you need to submit for this assignment is your Zipcode.java file and your README.txt file.
