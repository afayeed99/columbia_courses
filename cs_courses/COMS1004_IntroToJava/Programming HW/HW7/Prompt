Video Poker Part 1 (adapted from Cay Horstmann’s Big Java)

You must follow the instructions below to receive credit for this assignment.

Implement Card  and Deck classes in Java. These classes will be for use in the Video Poker project of Homework 8. 
A deck of standard playing cards consists of 52 cards. Each card belongs to one of four suits: 
Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, or Spades, and has a rank chosen from the set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace}.

Your Card class will have instance variables for suit and rank. Use the int type for both. 
Suits are ordered alphabetically: Clubs (1), Diamonds (2), Hearts (3), and Spades (4). 
Rank will be an integer from 1 to 13. Your Card class must implement the Comparable interface and must have a toString( ) method. 
Cards should be compared based on rank, the smaller the rank the smaller the card. In case of a tie, 
use the suit to break the tie with Clubs coming before Diamonds before Hearts before Spades. 
For example the 3 of Hearts is smaller than the 3 of Spades.

Your Deck class must have the following methods:

shuffle( ) - mixes up the deck and resets the top
deal( ) - returns the top card from the deck
toString( ) - prints the entire deck in its current order

Answers to Common Questions:
a) The suit order is clubs (1), diamonds (2), hearts (3), and spades (4) (It’s alphabetical)
b) When you implement the compareTo( ) method, you must first compare cards by their rank. Check the suit only if the ranks are equal.
c) Do not change the skeleton code
