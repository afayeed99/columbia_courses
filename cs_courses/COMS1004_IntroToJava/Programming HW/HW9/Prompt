1. In this problem you will alter the AudioBook and AudioBookCollection classes we saw in lecture so that a 
collection may be written to a file and then reloaded from that file in a future session. I have included all of the necessary files on Codio for your use.

Step 1: Add a method to the AudioBook class
public String summary()

that returns a String containing all of the book information for a given book. Each piece of information should be on it’s own line. So for example for Reynold’s Revenger it would return:

Revenger
Alastair Reynolds
Clare Corbett
22.94
880

Step 2 Write a method in the AudioBookCollection class
public void writeSummary(String fileName)

that creates a new text file with the name specified by the explicit parameter that contains all of the summary information for all of the audiobooks in the collection.

Step 3 Overload the constructor in the AudioBookCollection class with a new version
public AudioBookCollection(String fileName)

that creates a new AudioBookCollection object using all of the information in text file specified by the explicit parameter.

Common Questions Here are some answers to some commonly asked questions about this problem and some tips:

Q: Can I assume valid user input?
A: Yes.

Q: Can I assume that that a text file used for the new constructor will be in the same format as the one written by writeSummary?
A: Yes.
